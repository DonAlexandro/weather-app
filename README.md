# Weather App

This is a simple weather application, which I wrote using React and TypeScript.
Also, I used redux and redux-saga for state management and AntDesign for a UI.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
